* What is a bitcoin block?
A Bitcoin block header is an 80-byte structure that includes several
key components: a version number, a hash of the previous block, a
Merkle root (which summarizes all transactions in the block), a
timestamp, a difficulty target, and a nonce. This header serves as a
summary of the block's contents and is used in the mining process to
create a valid block hash.

Miners *must* verify the transactions they include in a block, because
if they don't, some invalid transaction may be included in the
block. A block with an invalid transaction will not be accepted by the
network, i.e. full nodes, which means that the miner wasted
electricity and did not receive any reward.
